function outpoints = tal2mni(inpoints)
% Converts coordinates to MNI brain best guess
% from Talairach coordinates
% FORMAT outpoints = tal2mni(inpoints)
% Where inpoints is N by 3 or 3 by N matrix of coordinates
%  (N being the number of points)
% outpoints is the coordinate matrix with MNI points
